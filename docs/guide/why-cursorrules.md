# Why .cursorrules?

`.cursorrules` files are special configuration files that help customize and enhance your experience with Cursor AI. They provide project-specific context and guidelines that help the AI better understand your codebase and generate more accurate and consistent code.

## Benefits

### 1. Project-Specific Context
- Provides clear guidelines about project structure
- Defines architectural decisions and patterns
- Explains commonly used methods and libraries

### 2. Consistent Code Generation
- Ensures AI-generated code follows project standards
- Maintains consistent coding style
- Reduces the need for manual corrections

### 3. Better Understanding
- Helps AI understand project-specific terminology
- Provides context about business logic
- Explains custom patterns and practices

### 4. Improved Collaboration
- Shares knowledge across team members
- Maintains consistency across different developers
- Documents important project decisions

## How It Works

1. Place a `.cursorrules` file in your repository root
2. The file's content is automatically appended to Cursor AI's context
3. AI uses these rules when generating or modifying code
4. Results are more aligned with your project's needs

## Best Practices

- Keep rules clear and concise
- Focus on project-specific guidelines
- Update rules as your project evolves
- Include examples for complex patterns
- Document architectural decisions
